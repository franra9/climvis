Description: # A climate visualization package
        
        **climvis** offers command line tools to display climate data in your browser.
        
        It was written for the University of Innsbruck's
        [scientific programming](http://fabienmaussion.info/scientific_programming)
        lecture as a package template for the assignments.
        
        ## HowTo
        
        Make sure you have all dependencies installed. These are:
        - numpy
        - pandas
        - xarray
        - motionless
        - matplotlib
        
        Download the package and install it development mode. From the root directory,
        do:
        
            $ pip install -e .
        
        If you are on a university computer, you should use:
        
            $ pip install --user -e .
        
        ## Command line interface
        
        ``setup.py`` defines an "entry point" for a script to be used as a
        command line program. Currently, the only command installed is ``cruvis``.
        
        After installation, just type:
        
            $ cruvis --help
        
        To see what it can do for you.
        
        ## Testing
        
        I recommend to use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) for testing. To test
        the package, do:
        
            $ pytest .
        
        From the package root directory.
        
        
        ## License
        
        With the exception of the ``setup.py`` file which was adapted from the
        [sampleproject](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject) package, all the
        code in this repository is dedicated to the public domain.
